# Linux

## Navigating the filesystem

Listing files:

```bash
$ ls
```

```bash
$ ls /
$ ls /dev/
```

This moves you to your `home` folder. This one is special.

```bash
$ cd
```

```bash
$ cd /dev/
$ ls
```

What to know where you are at in the filesystem?

```bash
$ pwd
```

## Working with files

Viewing file contents:

```bash
$ cat /etc/hosts
```

Make a new file:

```bash
$ nano test.txt
$ ls
```
